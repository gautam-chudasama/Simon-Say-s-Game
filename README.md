# Simon Says Game 🎮

A fun and interactive **Simon Says** memory game built using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**. This game challenges players to memorize and repeat an increasingly complex sequence of colors. It's a classic brain-training game, now playable in the browser!

## 🧠 How It Works

1. The game generates a random sequence of colors.
2. Each level adds a new color to the sequence.
3. The player must repeat the exact sequence by clicking on the colored buttons.
4. A wrong move ends the game, and the player can restart.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **HTML** – for structuring the game interface.
- **CSS** – for styling and animations.
- **JavaScript** – for game logic, user interaction, and sound effects.
